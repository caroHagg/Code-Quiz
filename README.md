# World-Trivia-Quiz
This is a trivia style multiple choice quiz game about the world! How much do you know? This website will test your knowledge. 

You will be presented with the tittle and a start button. Once you press the Start button a timer will run and a series of options will appear. Once you choose your option it will tell you if the answer was right or wrong. If the answer is wrong, the time will take off 5 seconds from the total. At the end you will see your final score and you will be able to add your initials. You will be able to reset the game if you want to play again.

Doing this website was fun and entertain. I've used a lot of the material we learned in class and I had the opportunity to debug my own code when I was testing for errors. 
My source for the questions were from https://slidelizard.com and I got more information about javascript from www.w3schools.com, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/.
